# Real-time-video-colorization

model for colorizing grayscale video frames in real time. The model should be able to process video streams and live webcam feeds.
A graphical user interface (GUI) should be given to display colorized video in real time and allow users to switch between colorization models.

There are two modes in the graphical user interface:-
1) real-time cam capture
2) video upload

you can also choose your training file externally for the model accuracy (file should be in the .h5 format).
